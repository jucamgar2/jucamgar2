My final degree work developed with Java 17 and SpringBoot 3.2.

It consists of a small graphic game where you have to guess the name of a soccer team from pieces of its shield. The application includes a solitaire mode, a local one-on-one mode and one-on-one online.

The project includes a report as documentation where important aspects and decisions of the project are discussed. In addition the project has a small study of the data of the items of the application, also included in the memory.
